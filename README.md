# PiCamera
A _very_ lightweight promise based Node.js wrapper for the [native Raspberry Pi Camera CLI tools](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/camera/raspicam/README.md).

_Note: This was written with the intent of NOT being a hand holding library, but rather just give you access to execute commands on the camera in a flexible way._

## Installation
### NPM 5
```
npm install pi-camera
```
### Older NPM
```
npm install pi-camera --save
```
